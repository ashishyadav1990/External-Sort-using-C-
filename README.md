# External-Sort-using-C-
External sorting is a sorting algorithm that can handle huge amounts of data.It is required when that data being sorted do not fit in the main memory(RAM). Hence, the file containing this large data is kept on the disk and chunks of this file are taken in the main memory, which are then sorted individually and then merged into one single output file.
